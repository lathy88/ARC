    Required Transformation: The input can contain any number of square boxes. The program should fill the square boxes
    with Red(Colour Code = 2) or Orange(Colour Code = 7) based on the Odd or Even number of blocks(or cell) inside the
    square box respectively.

    Implementation: The solution first tries to find the boxes in the grid. Once it identifies the non-zero cell and the
    adjacent cell is 0, We need to ensure that the cell is actually the start of the block to fill. We find that out by
    checking the corner cells for non-zero values.It indicates the start of the cell where we need to fill the row
    (within the square box boundary) with respective colour.
    The second step is to figure out which colour to fill. Either it can be 2 or 7. To find that we need to calculate
    the number of cells (Cells that need to fill with colour) inside the square box. If the count is even, we will it
    with 2 or 7 otherwise.
    The logic tries to fill on row basis i.e the counter is started once it identifies the start of the cell to fill.
    After the counter value is calculated, the entire row within the square box boundary is filled with corresponding
    colour based on the counter value.(i.e Even or Odd)

    Training & Test Grid: The solution works on all Training & Test cases
